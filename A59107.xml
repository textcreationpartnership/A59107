            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sad and lamentable NEWS from Rumford: Being a Sad and True RELATION of one <hi>William Stapeller</hi> a Drover, who was carried before a Justice, and being Examined, was put to find Bayl, but coming home to his House, he hanged himself upon a Horses Rack or Manger; upon Tuesday last, being the 15th. of this Instant <hi>September,</hi> 1674.</head>
            <p>STrange and dreadful now adays, are the Actions of poor sinful Mortals, no sooner can the sinful and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Action of one be past, but that another appears: No sooner can the dreadful Action of Theft be mentioned in the Mouth of a Man, but peradventure he shall present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear of the like Action of Theft committed by another: If Reports fly abroad of Murther, committed upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Man or Woman; no sooner can the Fire of that be kindled, but that another presently appears, springs forth and is presently heard of: VVe can hardly sleep in our Beds but that we shall quickly hear of one sad Accident or other.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35741:4"/>
            <p> If you hear not of Theft, it is a thousand to one if you don't hear of Murder, if you don't hear of Murder, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture but that you shall hear of dreadful matters, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by one wretch or other, either Murder, Theft, Rape, or such like sad Transactions. So that if a man had the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who writ so many Proverbs, and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Admonitions, whereby the Sons of Men might be (if grace were, which they so much slight, given to them, to be) as a Guide to their feet, and a Lanthorn to their Paths, to prevent and shun those damnable Courses of the Devil, who is the chief Instrument, and contriver of the lost and undone estate of poor Mankind.</p>
            <p>But alas, my poor Genious is too weak, as to speak one word in a proper sense of these things; neither is this our Age sufficient to blason forth so publick view the sad Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions of this our Age, committed by the Sons of men: How dreadful is it to hear that at one Sessions, that one and twenty should be justly Condemned, most shamefully to suffer by the hand of Justice, for their sad and dreadful Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Thefts, by them committed. God in mercy grant that those who were lately Executed, may be an Example, and a Cause to make them yet remaining in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and all others, to be fore-warned at the hearing of the cutting of, off the Nine of those their Companions, whose lives were then justly Sacrificed by the hand of Justice for their just deserts: that so they may fear and dread the just hand of God, who over-sees the ways of all men; and rightly judges and takes an Account of all that Men shall do, whether it be good or evil: As does appear even in this our days, for the dreadful News from the Sessions House, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but on Fryday last, would affright one, but would not in the least move the heart of this our sad Object, of whom we intend now to speak of: VVe say, could not in the least move him to Repentance; but like <hi>Judas,</hi> went and hanged himself. In the Town of <hi>Rumford</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> ten miles from <hi>London,</hi> lived a poor sinful wretch who regarded not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35741:4"/>the Law of God in the least; neither gave he heed to his just hand of Revenge, upon those that obey not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>

               </gap> beg of God for Saving Grace, that may deliver them in the day of evil, and in the hour of Temptation.</p>
            <p>This sinful Wretch <hi>William Stapeler,</hi> by name was a man that by outward view and appearance, was a sad sinfull Wretch, and a wicked and loose Liver, so that by the report of his Neighbours, h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> lived by little else but by pilfring and stea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing: Some reports, that he got his living altogether that way; some says, it h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th been his practice all his live time, to rob and steal from his poor Neighbours, and others; Others say and reports, that if he had had his just due, he had been hanged a year ago for stealing; others reports, him to be as sad a Wretch, for whoring, drinking, swearing, stealing, and such like as lived in those parts: And yet although the Mercy of God was such, as that his sins went a long time unpunished, and that his noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious faults escaped without punishment.</p>
            <p>Yet this poor Wretch, who was a Drover so called, and usually brought Cattel to <hi>Smithfield</hi> Market, and else where in <hi>London,</hi> would not forbear his sinful courses, but having a Girl, about thirteen years of age, coming to his house to lodge, and continuing in his house; upon a time the Devil put it into his heart, to commit uncleanness with this tender Bud, and making his attempt, he was by Gods Providence, and the good education of the young Damsel, hindred of his Hellish purpose: But he still going on in his unbridled Lust, he takes an advantage upon a time, when his Wife, and Children where out of the way, and deluding the poor Girl into a private room, where he most barbarously, and most filthyly, and a abominably, commited rape, or ravishment, upon the Body of this young Girl; who endeavored with loud shriks, and outcrys, to have made this unhuman Wretch to be discovered; although for a time it seemed to little purpose,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35741:5"/>but at length, before his deporture, she was hard to cry out and immediately Company came in, and understanding the matter, and circumstance of the business, of this beastly rape, and ravishment, he was laid hold on, and was carried before a Justice; and evidence coming against him, he was found guilty of his accusation, for which the Justice was send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to Goal, but he pleading to go under Bail, it was at length granted him.</p>
            <p>And going home with the Constables, to provide good se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, he was admitted to go into his own hoose without the Constable, but was as thought severly watched by them; but he coming into his house, told his Wife, that he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Justice, and that he was to find Bail, or else to go to Gaol; and moreover he told her, that if that he was accused for, should be proved against him at the Assises, he should be hanged; therefore he would get away from the Constables, and shift for himself, whereupon he gave her five shillings in money, and kissed her, and his Children, and went out at his back door, as though he had gone quite away from them all.</p>
            <p>But goes immediately into a Stable, where he takes a line, and fastning it to the Horses rack, he most desperately hangs himself: In the mean time the Constable comes for him, and his poor sorrowful Wife tells them, that she knows not of him, but great search was made, but he could not be found. But after it was over, a Neighbouring woman came, and told his Wise, that she see him go into such a Barn; but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would not believe her for a long time, hoping that he had been further off then so.</p>
            <p>But at length going to that Stable, where the Woman told her, she found him hanging dead upon the Horses rack; and coming out, she shriked, and cryed out in a most dreadful manner, tairing her hair, and wringing of hands, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that he may be a warning to all loose Liver.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35741:5"/>
            <p> And that he so may, let every good Christian power out their Prayers to God Almighty, that he may give wisdom to the foolish, and grace to the graceless, that so they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, from those evil, and dreadful ends, as this poor Wretch of whom we have spoken.</p>
            <p>Which he committed upon his own Body, upon the 15. of this instant September.</p>
